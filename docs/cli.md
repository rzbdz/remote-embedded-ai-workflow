# CLI reference

`bsp` is one command for people and programs. Every command accepts `--help`
(`bsp dut boot --help`).

## Global options

They may appear anywhere on the command line.

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `-r, --remote NAME[,NAME…]` | Board host(s) to talk to (names from `remotes.json`; unique prefixes work; `all` for every host) |
| `--url URL` | Talk to the host at this URL |
| `--token TOKEN` | API token for hosts that require one |
| `--json` | Machine-readable output (see [Output](#output-and-errors)) |
| `--stateless` | Ignore the saved default host and saved lease tokens; for parallel agents and CI |

How hosts are chosen without `-r`/`--url` is described in
[configuration.md](configuration.md#which-hosts-a-command-uses).

## Boards: `bsp dut`

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|

| `bsp dut boot DUT --files FILE… [--no-reset] [--first-wait S] [--later-wait S] [--port-timeout S] [--no-wait]` | Boot from RAM with local files in order (see [Booting local files](#booting-local-files)) |
| `bsp dut stage DUT FILE [--no-continue] [--timeout S]` | Send a local file to the host (once, by sha256) and load it into RAM: `fastboot stage` + `continue` |
| `bsp dut present DUT` | Whether the board's download/fastboot port is on the USB bus |
| `bsp dut console DUT "CMD" [--expect RE] [--timeout S]` | Run one shell command on the console and print its output |

| `bsp dut remove DUT [--force]` | Forget a board |
| `bsp dut export [--dir DIR] [--host HOST]` | Registered boards as YAML; `--dir` writes one `DIR/<id>.yaml` per board, the format of `SITE/duts/` |

**Leases.** `reset`, `boot`, `stage`, `console "CMD"`, `renew` and `release` need your lease; `set` and `rename`
need it while the board is leased. The CLI passes the remembered token; in stateless mode use
`--lease TOKEN` or `BSP_LEASE`.

**Editing boards.** `set`, `rename` and `remove` work on boards registered on the host (by
`probe`, `bind` or `add`). Boards defined in `SITE/duts/` are edited in their file.

### Boards reset by a person

Boards with the `human` control backend (for example slots made with `bsp dut bind`) have no
reset wiring. `bsp dut reset` and `bsp dut boot` then print what to do and wait:

```console
$ bsp dut reset slot-1
slot-1 @ lab-1: reset needs a person, job reset-1793860731-1 (confirm with `bsp dut confirm slot-1`)
  [   0.0s] ACTION NEEDED: press RESET on slot-1 (board-x); it boots into download mode
  [   0.0s] waiting for `bsp dut confirm slot-1` or for the board to show it on its own (timeout 900s)
```

The wait ends when someone runs `bsp dut confirm slot-1`, or as soon as bsp sees the board in
download mode on its console or USB port (for a plain reset: the SoC's boot-ROM output on the
console). If the board is not actually in download mode after a confirmation, the next step
fails with a fastboot timeout. Scripts and agents should run such commands in the background.

### Booting local files

`bsp dut boot DUT --files FSBL.bin u-boot-opensbi.itb Image.itb` boots a board from RAM with
files from your machine. Each file is sent to the board host once (by sha256; unchanged files
are not sent again, over HTTP or the ssh tunnel), then the host puts the board into download
mode (skip with `--no-reset`) and for each file runs `fastboot stage` + `continue` and waits for
the download port to come back before the next one: `--first-wait` seconds after the first file
(default 8, while the boot ROM hands over), `--later-wait` after later ones (default 3), then up
to `--port-timeout` more (default 20). If the port does not return, the boot stops and names the
file. It runs as a background job like `--sdk` boots, with the path and sha256 of every file in
the job log. Nothing is flashed.

Programs can do the same over HTTP: `PUT /api/v1/artifacts/<sha256>?name=FILE` with the file as
the body (checked against the sha256; `GET` the same URL to see whether it is cached), then
`dut_stage` or `dut_boot_files` with the sha256 values.

### Console pipe

`bsp dut pipe DUT` connects stdin and stdout to the board's serial-mux daemon and copies bytes
both ways until either side closes. The bytes are serial-mux's own protocol (4-byte length,
then JSON), so any serial-mux client can open a session through it; it is meant for programs
such as dashboards, not for typing. On a remote host the CLI runs a small Python bridge there
over the remote's `ssh` entry; on the host itself it connects to the socket directly. No lease
is needed: reading is open to everyone (as with `dut log`), and input is subject to the
console's serial-mux input gate. `bsp dut status` reports the socket as `console_socket` and
whether the daemon is up as `console_up`.

## Discovery and hosts

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `bsp hosts` | Reachable hosts, how they are reached, their modules and boards |
| `bsp -r REGISTRY registry list [--all]` | Hosts that announced themselves to a registry (see [configuration.md](configuration.md#host-registry)) |
| `bsp init` | First-run check: configuration directory, mode, hosts |
| `bsp probe [--pins P..] [--consoles C..] [--sdks LIST] [--dry-run] [--yes] [--no-identify] [--replace]` | Discover boards (pulses GPIO lines — see [getting-started.md](getting-started.md#option-a-probe-boards-wired-to-gpio-reset-lines)) |
| `bsp -r HOST probe --human [--rounds N] [--wait S] [--consoles C..] [--yes]` | Discover boards without reset wiring: a person puts one unregistered board at a time into download mode, and bsp pairs the console that speaks with the USB port that appears; each becomes a slot reset by a person, as with `dut bind` |
| `bsp remote list\|show\|add\|remove\|use` | Manage personal host entries |
| `bsp watch` | Stream live events from the host(s) |
| `bsp tools` | Print the host's AI tool schemas in Anthropic format (OpenAI format: `GET /api/v1/tools?format=openai`) |
| `bsp hints` | Hints from the configuration layers (packs, site) |
| `bsp install [--dir DIR] [--offline]` | Write `SKILL.md` for agents working in an SDK tree (see [agents.md](agents.md)) |

## SDKs: `bsp sdk`

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `bsp sdk list [--soc SOC]` | SDK targets, their SoC, workspace and boot-method status |
| `bsp sdk show SDK` | Build server, path, dev repos, components, artifacts, sharing |
| `bsp sdk status SDK` | Lease, branches, uncommitted files, recent builds |
| `bsp sdk plan SDK [COMPONENT] [--boot load\|download] [--variant V]` | Dry run: the build command or the boot steps |
| `bsp sdk acquire SDK --task NAME [--holder NAME] [--ttl S] [--branch B] [--projects LIST]` | Lease the workspace (default 8 h) and switch to branch `bsp/NAME` |
| `bsp sdk release SDK [--keep] [--force]` | Restore the owner's branch and stashed work |
| `bsp sdk build SDK COMPONENT [--clean] [--no-wait] [-v] [--timeout S]` | Build on the server; streams warnings and errors |
| `bsp sdk jobs SDK`, `bsp sdk job SDK ID [--follow] [--log]` | Build jobs |
| `bsp sdk exec SDK [--cwd DIR] [--read-only] [--timeout S] -- CMD…` | Run a command in the tree (cwd: first dev repo) |
| `bsp sdk get SDK PATH [-o FILE]`, `bsp sdk put SDK PATH FILE` | Read or write a file in the tree |

Commands that change the tree (`build`, `exec`, `put`) are refused while someone else holds the
workspace lease; hold it yourself while you work.

`exec` joins its arguments and runs them with `bash -c` on the build server, so quote once more
for words that must stay together: `bsp sdk exec SDK -- git commit -am "'usb: fix resume'"`.

See [sdk.md](sdk.md) for what acquire and release do to the tree.

## Host commands

These run on a board host; the CLI fetches their definitions from the host, so they are always
in sync with it. Add `-r HOST` when several hosts are reachable.

| Group | Commands |
|---|---|
| `bsp gpio` | `list`, `get`, `set`, `pulse`, `free`, `config`, `export`, `pinmux`, `alias add\|delete\|list\|resolve` |
| `bsp relay` | `on`, `off`, `toggle`, `pulse` |
| `bsp button` | `press`, `release`, `click` |
| `bsp board` | `info` |
| `bsp job` | `list`, `get` |
| `bsp events` | `recent` |
| `bsp status` | Service, module and backend health |

The same commands are HTTP endpoints (`GET` for reads, `POST` for changes, under `/api/v1/`) and
AI tools; `GET /api/v1/tools` lists them and `/docs` serves the OpenAPI description.

## Output and errors

Text output is meant for people. With `--json` every command prints exactly one object:

```json
{"ok": true, "result": {"...": "..."}}
{"ok": false, "error": {"code": "not_found", "message": "no DUT 'example-bord' on any reachable host",
                        "hint": "did you mean: example-board? known: example-board@lab-1", "details": {}}}
```

`hint` names the next step (a likely typo, who holds a lease, which command to run); `details`
carries context such as the console tail or the end of a build log. Long-running commands print
progress lines to stderr in JSON mode.

| Exit code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Success |
| 1 | The command failed |
| 2 | Usage error, or an ambiguous host for a state-changing command |
| 3 | No host reachable |
| 130 | Interrupted |
